  This presentation examines the transformative role of Geographical Indications (GIs) in promoting healthy and sustainable diets, particularly in light of shifting societal expectations. Traditionally focused on safeguarding local production methods and protecting the economic interests of producers, GIs are increasingly recognized as catalysts for innovation and sustainability within the food system (Mancini et al. 2005, Belletti et al. 2016). GIs serve as instruments for establishing quality, authenticity, and cultural heritage in food products, empowering consumers to make informed choices. By fostering a sense of place and community, GIs help redefine the relationship between producers and consumers, addressing the growing demand for transparency and sustainability in food sourcing. This presentation argues that GIs should not be viewed merely as protective labels but as dynamic social innovations that respond to contemporary challenges within food systems in a unique way. This presentation explores how GIs, along with two other food labels, i.e. Fairtrade and the Slow Food Presidia, contribute to collective progress toward healthy and sustainable eating. By relying on differentiation based on newly integrated health and sustainability criteria, these labels enable the formulation of standards tailored to the specific challenges faced in their respective production areas. Each label defines its own ambitions, rules, and adjustments in a pragmatic manner, representing their “promise of difference” (Le Velly, 2017). This evolution reflects the capacity of stakeholders to envision and implement new forms of collective organization, although the outcomes are sometimes controversial. The first part of the presentation analyzes how GIs and the other studied labels have evolved to incorporate health and sustainability criteria, illustrating their potential to influence broader dietary patterns. The second part examines the opportunities and challenges these labels encounter in advancing a sustainable food system while ensuring that local communities reap economic and social benefits. By highlighting the distinct contributions, strengths and limitations of GIs alongside Fairtrade and Presidia, this presentation emphasizes the necessity for food labels to adapt to the demands of a changing world. It posits that GIs, through their deep-rooted connections to local contexts and collaborative governance, can effectively contribute to a more sustainable and equitable food system that meets the diverse needs of both consumers and producers.
