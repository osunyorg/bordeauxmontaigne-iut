  This article analyses a case study of a local initiative in India aimed at promoting greater justice in the area. The initiative is a fair trade town. Using the capability approach, we show how difficult it is for this initiative to generate a collective local dynamic. We base our analysis on the notion of collective territorial capability. More specifically, we show that, while the internal dynamics of the members of the initiative enable them to develop their project, the way in which these members are perceived by the rest of the population in the area is a hindrance.
