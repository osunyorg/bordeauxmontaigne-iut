abstract: >-
  Traders are key - producer level impacts depend on volumes sold to and by traders on fairtrade terms • Most traders have fairtrade as their core mission or as a mission-driven csr strategy • Fairtrade engagement does change companies' supply chain behavior • Company size matters - micro and large companies are the most engaged • Traders do not believe that their benefits come from standards compliance, but rather from project based partnerships • Consumers value bananas, cocoa and coffee differently; they are not willing to pay the same fairtrade price for different products.
