abstract: >-
  This paper is part of a three-year research project (2021-2024), funded by the Nouvelle Aquitaine Region, to analyse the impact of the health crisis on the region's professional cultural sector. While the concept of crisis can be used to emphasise the urgency of tackling problems, it is more useful for understanding the current situation as a stage in the transformation and evolution of the cultural sector.
