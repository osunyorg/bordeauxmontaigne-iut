abstract: >-
  Organizations communicate in complex and various ways, and the context is mainly characterized by the pervasiveness of the digital ecosystem, including the Web, social networks and the Internet of data. However, its information delivery cannot overlook the requirements of multicultural communications at a variety of levels. Digital Presences of Organizations highlights the communication roadblocks faced by organizations as they emerge, arising not only from issues encountered on their own websites, but also as they construct online narratives. This multi-faceted and multi-strategy digital presence of organizations is addressed via three main thematic axes. The first focuses on differentiated strategies (content, services, interaction) that can be observed depending on the types of organizations and their users. The second examines the cultural dimension of websites, ranging from the local to the global. Finally, the third focuses on the role of narration in organizations’ online communication strategies.
