abstract: >-
  The objective of this communication is to analyse the organisational model of the institutional place and its limits in a context of change. The cultural third place model which examines the relationship with the public, the territory and culture in a unique way can be used as a lens through which to rethink the functions of institutional cultural venues, and to understand how they can evolve in the light of contemporary transitions.
