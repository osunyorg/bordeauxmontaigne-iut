  Virtual Reality (VR) is experiencing continuous growth in France, with 49% of the French population having already experienced it, and the majority expressing high satisfaction with their VR experiences (CNC 2023). The French ecosystem for immersive content production is notably active and internationally appealing, with recognition for its quality at festivals such as Venice and other specialized events. Traditional players in new media, such as Arte and France Télévisions, have also contributed to this visibility.Despite the burgeoning interest in VR, the economic and artistic challenges arising from its distribution remain significant. Various stakeholders from different fields, including video games, cinema, visual arts, and live performances, tend to apply familiar legal and economic models (Rochelandet et al. 2019). Currently, two main distribution options are emerging: online streaming and location-based experiences, especially within cultural venues. However, these approaches present distinct challenges and opportunities.This article primarily examines the economic and artistic implications of implementing technical standardization in VR works. From an economic standpoint, this raises questions about the need for technical standards in an environment where substantial public and private funding is invested in the development of this art form. Technical standardization encompasses various essential aspects, such as the normalization of technological components, the development of management platforms, the establishment of standardized distribution formats, the implementation of standardized distribution systems, and the creation of adapted economic models. Simultaneously, this issue presents an artistic challenge, as it raises concerns about the risk of artistic homogenization (Bouquillon 2015).
