abstract: >-
  In this paper a genetic matching scheme is extended to take into account primitive arcs and complex description in the pattern recognition process. Classical ways only focus on segments and are sensitive to over segmentation effect. Our approach allows to improve the recognition by handling more accurate description and also to decrease processing time by limiting the number of vertices to match. Experimental studies using real data attest the robustness of our approach.
