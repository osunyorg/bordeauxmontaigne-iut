abstract: >-
  Even though the emotional state is increasingly taken into account in scientific studies aimed at determining user experience of user acceptance, there are still only a few normalized tools. In this article, we decided to focus on mood determination as we consider this affective state to be more pervasive and more understandable by the person who is experiencing it. Thus, we propose a prototypical tool called SYM (Spot Your Mood) as a new tool in user mood determination to be used in many different situations.
