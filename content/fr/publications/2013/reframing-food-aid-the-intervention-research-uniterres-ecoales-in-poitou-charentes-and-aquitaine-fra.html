  This paper is based on the intervention research ECOALES (" Empowerment, Comportements Alimentaires et Economie Solidaire "- Empowerment, Food Behaviour and Social Economy) which is led in partnership with the Association Nationale de Développement des Épiceries Solidaires A.N.D.E.S - National Association for solidarity food stores). This association has set up an innovative short supply channel for fruit, vegetable and eggs, for solidarity grocery recipients. This experience has started in June 2012 in Poitou-Charentes and in November 2012 in Aquitaine. One of the objectives is to increase the consumption of fresh fruit and vegetable among food aid recipients; another one is to support farmers temporarily by buying their products at a sustainable price (thanks to public funding) via a pre-order system. This intervention also includes cooking workshops, visits to farms and special festive events around a chef and farmers, aiming at replacing food in its social, cultural and participative dimensions. The underlying hypothesis is that the valorisation of relations between producers and consumers and culinary competence are beneficial to food habits and behaviours and therefore to health. The project monitoring in both regions reveals the importance of logistics in the organisation of both collection and delivery of farm products: in fact the role (and personality) of both coordinators hired (one in Poitou-Charentes, the other one in Aquitaine) appears to be a key element for the success of the whole Uniterres project. We will particularly focus on the diverse constraints to be reconciled: the creation of a link between grocery stores and farmers, who voluntarily take part to this intervention, but who are spread over a large territory; the articulation between support to farmers in a difficult situation and supply in quality fruit and vegetable in sufficient quantity; meeting the consumers' expectations, considering seasonal and weather variability and product availability. We'll also assess the adaptations and reconfigurations which have been necessary after one year of operation and just as the second production campaign is starting. Methods: The fieldwork (including participant observation) has followed the lines of a global approach, with the diverse protagonists involved in this intervention: farmers, solidarity food outlet' staff, beneficiaries as well as partners, representing the diverse institutions involved in the project (Aquitaine and Poitou-Charentes Regions, DRAAF -Regional Authority for Agriculture-, MSA -Agriculture Social Security-, Chambres d'agricultures, etc. ). The originality of the methodology is the interdisciplinary dialogue with the association of anthropology and economy. Interdisciplinary collaboration, complementarity of perspectives contribute to a finer understanding, through shared bibliography, cross-reference of research problematics, complementarity in data collection, which offer a richer analysis ; coordination for sharing data collection is important for better efficiency, considering the fragile situation of most of our informants. Results: The analysis enables us to highlight regional specificities which impact the project: types of productions available on each territory, the social status of participant farmers, etc. Three types of complementary results for flow analysis: 1/ The farmers perspective: an innovative aspect for most farmers who so far were involved in non-contractual sales modes (Poitou-Charentes); more or less profitable combinations with direct sales through the AMAP system (Association for the maintenance of small local farming) (Aquitaine). 2/ The customers perspective: fruit and vegetable supply in solidarity food outlets. Several supplying modes co-exist, compete and complement one another, short or long chain supplying modes; such channels meet demands linked to consumption choices in such food outlets as well as the traditional supply organisation mode of food aid ; however problematics related to logistics are also very important : stock capacity, transportation, refrigeration facilities, display and distribution mode, etc. 3/ The logistics element is central in this project for several reasons: sustainability, economy, and also because of the concrete relationship the coordinator has established between consumers (solidarity food outlets) and farmers; as well as among farmers. It also reveals the aspects of relations between farmers and professional institutions generally speaking (the shifting of their affiliation networks), because this type of supplying mode reveals a food system, and more specifically the place of fruit and vegetable in the Poitiers urban area: the flow of people, goods, knowledge, which shape urban foodsheds and impact urban/ rural ties. Conclusion: This contribution is an original case study assessing the impact of an innovative supplying mode, aiming at developing links between urban consumers and local producers. It also examines the current conditions shaping the creation of fair and sustainable markets (Food aid at local/ global scale). The original methodology, which combines interdisciplinary perspectives (anthropology and economy), offers better understanding of what's at stake, which might lead to an improved development for further food security actions.
