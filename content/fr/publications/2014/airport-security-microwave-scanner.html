abstract: >-
  Recent events have shown that a determined terrorist could be able to board in a plane with explosive materials to blow up the plane during the flight. The risk that a kamikaze perpetrates a terrorist attack in the cabin of a plane is undeniably real. SAMOSA project falls within this context. Its objective is to develop a new detection system, based on microwave imaging technology, allowing the detection of embedded explosive on a flight passenger. The explosive could be carried closed to the body or subcutaneous. This new technology has many advantages compared to the existing one. It allows detecting explosives located on human body without revealing the intimate anatomy of passengers, this point being the main problem with the current deployed technology. The project suggests developing an advanced technology which could be used during the filtering and inspection boarding phases to improve the results related to this threat. In addition, the project is in the current tendency of developing advanced vision technology. However, addressing social ethic and juridical aspects of this kind of systems, the project will bring a new lighting about civil security tools and their integration in civil society.
