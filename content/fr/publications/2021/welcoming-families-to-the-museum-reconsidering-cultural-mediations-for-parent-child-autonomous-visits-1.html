  Most of France’s local museums are coping with a contrasting situation: school visits are very successful and receive appreciative comments, whereas autonomous leisure family visits are disappointing and are sometimes damaging to the museum’s reputation. Welcoming families for a leisure museum visit raises two issues: the impossibility of offering a guided visit to every family because of a lack of staff and finances, and the need for innovative interactive pathways that allow families to visit without the benefit of a guide or curator. The authors engaged in an action-research process with the Angoulême paper museum, with the aim of designing an autonomous leisure visit for families with “tweens.” A constructivist framework was elaborated to design an interactive family visit using two interconnected mobile applications and to support the scaffolding role of parents with respect to their child.
