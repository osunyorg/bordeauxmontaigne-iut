  This study examines the experiences of Roma migrants in French, Italian and Spanish cities. The research concentrated on key aspects of daily life, including mobility, access to housing and economic resources, and social interactions, such as conviviality, the formation and maintenance of friendships, and the nature of social ties. To this end, we reconstructed 75 life trajectories and produced 12 case studies. We employed a life course approach based on individuals, combined with a comparative approach, in order to identify similarities and differences in the phenomena observed. This enabled us to ascertain the effects of context and personal trajectories on the integration process. Public policy, in addition to violence and institutional discrimination, has a significant impact on the lives of Roma migrants. Such circumstances compel individuals to engage in continuous adaptation, even if they do not necessarily challenge existing forms of social interaction. In this regard, it is evident that Roma migrants exhibit similar characteristics to the majority of other migrants. 1) The extended family continues to serve as the primary social interactional sphere. Indeed, it appears to be reinforced in the context of migration, which compels individuals to regroup due to the advanced marginality of their living conditions. Many Roma migrants develop strong forms of familial and social poli-activity, as well as deep "combinatory skills." 2) Based on a combination of strong and weak ties, the group of peers transcends ethnic boundaries and closed niches to establish a reference point within which strategies of upward mobility, integration, and social differentiation are conceived and pursued. 3) Individuals are not constrained to the boundaries of the family and the ethnic group, but rather traverse two distinct realms: that of the family and that of the context in which they reside and work. 4) For a considerable proportion of these individuals, precarity persists, characterised by inadequate housing conditions and restricted access to the formal labour market. The presence of local welfare, active advocacy groups for the rights of the poor, and everyday policy-making by cities and regions are significant factors that contribute to the overall situation.
